# **Christopher Schrader - CSE 15L Lab 1**

## cd examples:

*No argument:*

* ![Image](image1.png)
* The working directory was /lecture1 at the time the command was run.
* After the command was run, the working directory changed to /home. This indicates that no argument with the cd command moves you to the home directory.
* This was not an error.

*Directory as argument:*

* ![Image](image2.png)
* The working directory was /home at the time the command was run.
* After the command was run, it changed the working directory to /lecture1. This is because our /home/ directory had a lecture1 directory, which was the argument passed to cd.
* This was not an error.

*File as argument:*

* ![Image](image3.png)
* The working directory was /lecture1 at the time the command was run.
* The output "Not a directory" was displayed. I got this output because cd cannot take in a file as an argument, only directories.
* This was an error since we tried to change our directory to a file.
